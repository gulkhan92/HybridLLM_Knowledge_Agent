Coal, Coke and Raw
Materials

Facilities include pilot and laboratory
scale equipment for the
characterisation of coal, its
transformation to coke and subsequent
evaluation. This expertise is equally
relevant to the steel industry, seeking
greater understanding and control of
input materials and to coal mining
companies, seeking a better
appreciation of processes to meet their
client’s needs.

The Institute operates a fully
instrumented moving wall coke oven
with a 350kg capacity for pilot-scale
carbonisation.

Facilities and expertise support the
assessment and optimisation of raw
materials.

This Includes:

> Pilot-scale Coke Oven

> Conveying Technology
> Raw Materials Handling
> Blending

> Performance and Value
Assessments

The Institute is able to advise the refiner
and raw materials supplier on the value
in use of input materials and the
optimum use of blends.

Steelmaking and Casting

Ranging from engineering support, through the process metallurgy of
steelmaking and on to the continuous casting plant, the Institute
specialises in providing both on plant technical support and off-line
research projects.

Steelmaking and casting support:

> Short term technical projects that address clearly
defined issues and challenges

> Long term and strategic research programmes

Project teams and engineers at the Institute have many years practical
experience covering steel plant, continuous casting and rolling mill
operations; this is supported by science based expertise, extensive
laboratories and supporting facilities.
