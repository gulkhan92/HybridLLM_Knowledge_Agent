SCIENCE

Fully equipped laboratories,
experienced scientists and
project teams

Process Simulation
and Design

Process simulation is carried out to support
process and product development.
Techniques utilised include CFD, FEM and
extensive physical modelling.

These combine to enable the Institute to gain
that fundamental understanding of what is
actually taking place on plant, to help drive
process improvements from a position of
sound knowledge.

Refractories and
Mould Powders

The Institute combines thermodynamic
modelling with a well-equipped ceramics
laboratory, where the performance and
properties of powders and lubricants are
determined.

Facilities and equipment includes a high
temperature viscometer, STA, a wettability
and hot stage microscope used to evaluate
the impact of powder chemistry and
morphology on physical properties and
process parameters.

These are complimented by expertise and
testing capability covering a wide range of
refractory materials.

Metallurigcal

The Institute’s metallography laboratory includes a wide range of optical
microscopy equipment, complemented by a state of the art FEG-SEM. This
equipment, in combination with experienced scientists and engineers,
enables the Institute to offer fundamental forensic investigations into the
root causes of many typical production defects, plus those that are more
novel.

This service is often combined with process design and engineering to
deliver comprehensive solutions. Metallurgical expertise also plays a leading
role in understanding the fundamental effects of composition on the
behaviour of steel products.

Technical Training

The institute runs a regular programme of technical training courses that
cover all the areas commonly associated with today’s steel industry. In
addition, the Institute can offer bespoke technical courses that meet a
client's specific needs.
