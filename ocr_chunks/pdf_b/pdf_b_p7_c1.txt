in next generation products
for automotive, rail and plate
applications

Product and Process Development
The Institute operates tonnage scale melting and casting
facilities. These include steelmaking capability at heat
sizes of up to 7 tonnes, supported by ladle metallurgy and
tank degassing units.

Fully instrumented pilot facilities replicate a full-scale steel
plant and are complimented by a pilot continuous casting
machine, which can produce billet and mini-slab in a
range of sizes.

This supports clients by:

> Proving the next generation of process
developments in a controlled off-line
environment, away from the pressures
and risks associated with carrying out
development work during tonnage
production.

> Providing a production facility for pilot
quantities of new steel grades to support
product development programmes.

Energy and Engineering

The Institute has extensive experience in process integration
and extension. Many of today’s steelmaking plants are a mix of
new installations and the continued development of existing
assets, with each bringing a range of very different technical
challenges.

Client support includes:

> Wide-ranging expertise in maximising
the capability of existing assets, either in
terms of productivity, or in the form of new
product capability. This applies to the asset
itself, as well as overall process performance.

> Caster development, from fundamental
engineering, flow visualisation and modelling,
through to improved process monitoring and
control; delivering reduced costs and
extending the capability of already installed
concast plants.

> Continued development work on new
installations to increase product range
and improve operating performance.

> Advice on value in use of both raw materials
and works arisings, including a clear
understanding of the environmental
impact of every stage of the steelmaking
process.
