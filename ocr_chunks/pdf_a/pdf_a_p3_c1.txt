only to intense mechanical stimuli, but also to heat and
to noxious chemicals. These receptors respond to minute
punctures of the epithelium, with a response magnitude
that depends on the degree of tissue deformation. They al-
so respond to temperatures in the range of 40-60°C, and
change their response rates as a linear function of warm-
ing (in contrast with the saturating responses displayed by
non-noxious thermoreceptors at high temperatures).

Pain signals can be separated into individual compo-
nents, corresponding to different types of nerve fibers
used for transmitting these signals. The rapidly transmit-
ted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is
called first pain or cutaneous pricking pain. It is well local-
ized and easily tolerated. The much slower, highly affec-
tive component is called second pain or burning pain; it is
poorly localized and poorly tolerated. The third or deep
pain, arising from viscera, musculature and joints, is also
poorly localized, can be chronic and is often associated
with referred pain.

Muscle Spindles

Scattered throughout virtually every striated muscle in the
body are long, thin, stretch receptors called muscle spin-
dles. They are quite simple in principle, consisting of a few
small muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle
third of the fibers. These fibers are called intrafusal fibers,
in contrast to the ordinary extrafusal fibers. The ends of the
intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so when-
ever the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also
stretched. The central region of each intrafusal fiber has
