few myofilaments and is non-contractile, but it does have
one or more sensory endings applied to it. When the mus-
cle is stretched, the central part of the intrafusal fiber is
stretched and each sensory ending fires impulses.

Muscle spindles also receive a motor innervation. The
large motor neurons that supply extrafusal muscle fibers
are called alpha motor neurons, while the smaller ones sup-
plying the contractile portions of intrafusal fibers are
called gamma neurons. Gamma motor neurons can regu-
late the sensitivity of the muscle spindle so that this sen-
sitivity can be maintained at any given muscle length.

Joint receptors

The joint receptors are low-threshold mechanoreceptors
and have been divided into four groups. They signal differ-
ent characteristics of joint function (position, movements,
direction and speed of movements). The free receptors or
type 4 joint receptors are nociceptors.
