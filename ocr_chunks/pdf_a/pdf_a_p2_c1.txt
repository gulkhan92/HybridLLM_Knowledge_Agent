nections in spinal cord (middle)
and expanded schematic (right).
The spindle is a stretch receptor
with its own motor supply con-
sisting of several intrafusal mus-
cle fibres. The sensory endings of
a primary (group Ia) afferent and
a secondary (group II) afferent
coil around the non-contractile
central portions of the intrafusal
fibres.

rapidly adapting afferent activity, muscle force increases
reflexively until the gripped object no longer moves. Such
a rapid response to a tactile stimulus is a clear indication
of the role played by somatosensory neurons in motor ac-
tivity.

The slowly adapting Merkel’s receptors are responsible
for form and texture perception. As would be expected for
receptors mediating form perception, Merkel’s receptors
are present at high density in the digits and around the
mouth (50/mm? of skin surface), at lower density in oth-
er glabrous surfaces, and at very low density in hairy skin.
This innervations density shrinks progressively with the
passage of time so that by the age of 50, the density in hu-
man digits is reduced to 10/mm?. Unlike rapidly adapting
axons, slowly adapting fibers respond not only to the ini-
tial indentation of skin, but also to sustained indentation
up to several seconds in duration.

Activation of the rapidly adapting Pacinian corpuscles
gives a feeling of vibration, while the slowly adapting
Ruffini corpuscles respond to the lataral movement or
stretching of skin.

Nociceptors

Nociceptors have free nerve endings. Functionally, skin
nociceptors are either high-threshold mechanoreceptors
or polymodal receptors. Polymodal receptors respond not
