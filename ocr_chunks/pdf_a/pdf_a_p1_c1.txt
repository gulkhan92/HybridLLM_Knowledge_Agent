Anatomy of the Somatosensory System

FROM WIKIBOOKS!

Our somatosensory system consists of sensors in the skin
and sensors in our muscles, tendons, and joints. The re-
ceptors in the skin, the so called cutaneous receptors, tell
us about temperature (thermoreceptors), pressure and sur-
face texture (mechano receptors), and pain (nociceptors).
The receptors in muscles and joints provide information
about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles.

Cutaneous receptors

Sensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly
adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force when
objects are lifted. These afferents respond with a brief
burst of action potentials when objects move a small dis-
tance during the early stages of lifting. In response to

Figure 1: Receptors in the hu-
man skin: Mechanoreceptors can
be free receptors or encapsulated.
Examples for free receptors are
the hair receptors at the roots of
hairs. Encapsulated receptors are
the Pacinian corpuscles and the
receptors in the glabrous (hair-
less) skin: Meissner corpuscles,
Ruffini corpuscles and Merkel’s
disks.
